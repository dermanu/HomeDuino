This is the code for a simple home automation using Arduino and cheap wireless power switches.

I used a Arduino UNO with a network shield attached to 433.92 MHz transmitter (17 cm antenna). Using a oscilloscope (DOS) the switching code of the wirless power switche's remote controll can be obtained.

To be able to control the Arduino within you local WIFI you can download: https://netioapp.com/de/
