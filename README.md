# HomeDuino
This is the code for a simple home automation using Arduino and cheap wireless power switches.

I used a Arduino UNO with a network shield attached to 433.92 MHz transmitter (17 cm antenna). Using an oscilloscope (DOS) the switching code of the wirless power switche's remote control was obtained.

To be able to control the Arduino within you local WIFI you either access the Arduino via it's IP using your browser or the app https://netioapp.com/de/ using the uploaded Arduhome.json. 

I currently do not have the index.html file that has to be saved on SD-card inserted into the Arduino Network Shield. This allows to display a simple user interface in the browser.
