# HomeDuino
This is the code for a simple home automation using Arduino and cheap wireless power switches.

I used a Arduino UNO with a network shield attached to 433.92 MHz transmitter (17 cm antenna). Using a oscilloscope (DOS) the switching code of the wirless power switche's remote controll was obtained.

To be able to control the Arduino within you local WIFI you either acces the Arduino via it's IP using your broser or the app: https://netioapp.com/de/
